# GitHub User Activity CLI
## Overview
This is a simple command line interface (CLI) to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tintrungp/GitHub-User-Activity.git
```

2. Run the program
```sh
python3 github.py 
```

## How to Use It
The tool only has one functionality, which is fetching the input user's recent
GitHub Activity

### Choosing Your User
When the program is run, the user will be prompted. They can enter in any GitHub username and that user's activity will be printed to the console.

An example:
``` 
github-activity <username>
```

## Exiting
Finally, in order to exit the GitHub User Activity tool, there are 2 options. When prompted use `q` or `quit` to exit. 

# Conclusion
This is a small project. There are hopes for it to be extended into it's own window gui project with the use of the [Pysimplegui library](https://docs.pysimplegui.com/en/latest/). It's not much, but it's the start of something cool for me.

A future roadmap might look like the following...
- [ ] Add Changelog
- [ ] Add GUI interface
- [ ] Extend functionality for other user abilities
- [ ] Utilize API Key of user for more detailed results
